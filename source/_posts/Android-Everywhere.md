Android OS TV, Auto, Wear, Substance Design and Android applications on Chrome define the OS's push onto even more screens, as fortunes surge and fall in the smartphone world.

We notice how a push directly into new device categories, mixed with an all-new design and style language, turned Android in to the OS for everything.

<!-- more -->

When you are dominating the smartphone globe and successfully carving out a niche against The apple company in the tablet space, exactly where can you go next? Inside 2014, the answer regarding Android was everywhere. Within the space of a dozen months, Android exploded on to wearable, TVs (again, following the ill-fated Google TV push), cars and even Chromebooks. Android was quickly going from being Google's mobile OS to the company's everything OS.

In the particular seventh part of the Android History series, we will look at how Yahoo launched Android Auto, Android OS TV and Android Use to enhance Android into fresh frontiers. We'll examine changing fortunes in the mobile phone world, as Samsung stumbles and LG rises. Plus we'll observe how Lollipop plus a new batch regarding Nexus devices set the stage for the 3rd age of Android.

# Android OS goes wearable

In typically the year before we really got an official Google-sanctioned Android wearable, the thought of Google making a new smartwatch wasn't just possible or likely, it absolutely was sort of obvious. Although the unannounced Apple Watch was nevertheless more than a year away from being available, Samsung had maintained to ship the initial mass-market Android watch, the Universe Gear in the tumble of 2013. And other folks like Pebble had previously proved the potential of the concept.

Given Google's track record with Android OS on phones and capsules, many industry watchers predicted the business to adopt the similar strategy for wearable. Maybe you'd have the Nexus watch to punch things off, then producers will be free to go wild using their own suggestions. Diversity (or if an individual prefer, fragmentation) would occur, and market share might soar.

When Android Wear eventually arrived, though, the truth was much different. In essence, every watch had been a Nexus watch, in addition to it was clear of which Google intended to handle the consumer experience and application of these wearables much even more closely than it got phones or tablets.

Every single watch was a Nexus watch. And everyone got to play by Google's rules.

Similarly, Android Wear itself was never open-sourced, with Google contending that it was already developed on AOSP, the Android OS Open Source Project.

Presently there were a few good causes for this more shut down approach. Firstly, Android Use relied heavily on the particular (very closed-source) Google Perform Services on both the particular watch and the phone. And in being less open, Google would stop a sea of inexpensive, unsupported soon-to-be-abandoned wearables from hitting various markets.

Smartwatch manufacturers were free to identify through design and pre-loaded apps, of course, but otherwise they had to be able to play by Google's guidelines -- much more thus than in the smartphone world.

With the story of Android Wear by itself came hardware from LG (with the G Watch) and Motorola (with the particular Moto 360). Motorola had been already in the method of reinventing itself because "a Google company, inches as well as the beautiful round enjoy that it announced was the big story on the particular day. By contrast, LG's effort seemed like a new reference product, oddly lacking of any real style or flair. (The exact same could be said regarding Samsung's later Android Use effort, the Gear Live, which shipped alongside typically the G Watch. )

"Android Wear did not actually have a round UI."

But the Motocicleta 360 and its rounded display didn't just occur. Actually in the time before its announcement, Android OS Wear was very very much a square-only platform. Motorola's Senior Vice President regarding Consumer Experience Design, John Wicks, told Android Key that Moto itself needed to push to make their vision of a round smartwatch an actuality.

"The fascinating thing is, Android Put on did not originally possess a round UI. It was rectangular, " Wicks claims, "When [Google] saw what we were doing in 'round,' and the way we were driving things there, it prompted them to go and do 'round' and will include a round edition of Android Wear."

"In fact, the URINARY INCONTINENCE work for the SpOStamento 360 was a cooperation."

"In fact, typically the UI work for the very first one has been a collaboration. Our developers were engaged in creating that first round UI for Android because that was the means for us to get it to advertise in time. And within the finish result that all becomes Android Put on. "

That extra UI work contributed to the long lead time to the Moto 360's release, since AC learned from reporters around that time. Because one device maker quipped to a selection of press at the time, "making a round screen is not that hard. " This was the software that every person was waiting on.

Inside the following year, rounded designs have dominated Google android Wear, with only ASUS sticking with a a lot more traditional square UI via its ZenWatch series.

Typically the software and UI had been only half the struggle, though. The first variation of Android Wear, Android OS 4. 4W, relied heavily on voice controls, weren't getting fast access to an application drawer and had relatively minimal support for running programs on the watch alone. Instead it was exactly about glanceable notifications and interacting with your phone's software from a distance. In essence, the opposing approach to what Special was doing within the Universe Gear.

At the time of writing we're nevertheless figuring out what a wrist-based computer should do and just how it should behave. Just now are the Samsung in addition to Google software strategies gradually approaching good common ground.

# Android Auto

"In many ways our cars keep us all attached to the actual physical worlds around us, nonetheless they remain disconnected from our other devices inside our electronic lives. "

That was from Google's Patrick Brady in announcing Android Auto from the Google I/O creator conference in mid-2014. As well as in a lot of techniques it couldn't be even more true. Aside from simple Bluetooth connections and the smattering of proprietary manufacturer systems, there had recently been very little for mobile phone users to enjoy in a vehicle.

Whatever you can actually do along with Android Auto is limited by design. And that's mostly a good point.

There also are a new few after-market options, which includes three from Pioneer, plus a couple from Kenwood. We're still expecting even more companies to jump inside that ring at several point.

As for whatever you can actually do along with Android Auto, well, it can limited. On purpose. Press software can mostly carry out their thing songs and pod-casts and the particular like. But not movie. By design, Android Automobile and compatible apps are unable to be (and, in our own experience, aren't) distracting. Messages, on the other palm, can get slightly fascinating, as there isn't genuinely way to keep a good application from bugging an individual in a vehicle. Google Hangouts in addition to Messaging can read newly arriving messages, just like a small number of other apps. Yet you'll quickly learn there are a difference between an periodic back-and-forth, and getting trapped in the ping-ping-ping-ping regarding a Skype conversation.

Yet it's early days nevertheless for Android Auto. Because we look back about the history of Google android, it's clear that applying our smartphones in the particular car safely will only increase in value, and that Android Automobile will play a major portion in the foreseeable future.

# HTC One, Consider About three

After years regarding disjointed launches in different countries, the 2013 HTC One (M7) had surfaced as a singular worldwide flagship for the Taiwanese firm. Although the more compact One Mini and supersized One Max hadn't already been huge successes, the M7 itself was critically acknowledged and well received by customers. It seemed like nobody in the Android world could challenge THE ALL NEW HTC on build quality and materials, and so typically the company went into 2014 looking to take typically the strengths of the HTC 1 to the next level.

From the tender was the HTC One (M8): softer metallic curves, a greater screen, a weird depth-sensing camera and a name that brought "M8" from a codename to a part regarding HTC's brand. In reality, in the run upwards to launch the cell phone was known in logOS as simply "the new HTC One. " The particular name printed on some early retail boxes has been "HTC One. " Getting "M8" to the front, it seemed, was a little of a last-minute selection -- likely to stay away from confusion with last year's model, that has been itself re-branded as HTC One (M7).

Regardless, difficult we were unable accustomed to delete word many HTC Ones. 2012 had given us an Buchstabenfolge soup of One-branded handsets, a trend that's carried on to this day.

Typically the phone itself, like their predecessor, was your kind of gadget that inspired awe any time picked up the first time. The particular curved metal was smooth in the hand, but was a joy to hold, arguably outclassing the newest iPhones of the moment. The M8 felt unique in a manner that no HTC phone since has really handled to capture.

Peter Chou spent time carrying close to wooden M8 mock-ups to ensure the in-hand sense was just right.

Then-CEO Peter Chou, we're advised, spent time carrying about wooden mock-ups of typically the M8 to ensure the in-hand feel was merely right.

And HTC's Perception software got a fresh coat of paint, with lighter colours, further customizability and new photo-editing techniques.

That was largely due to unique depth-sensing "Duo camera" fitted to the back of the phone. This didn't capture images on its own, but that could provide depth details for shots captured together with the main camera, and these types of could then be used to be able to apply artistic and 3 DIMENSIONAL effects to the images. The sole problem was the key rear camera, HTC's 4-megapixel "Ultra-pixel" unit, hadn't altered much since the M7. As before, it had been above average in little light, but performed miserably in certain outdoor scenes.

It appeared like HTC had fumbled certainly one of the main parts of a smartphone -- the digicam -- and tried to be able to compensate with gimmickry. Inside the months that implemented, rivals were able to be able to emulate the M8's depth-based tricks in software, with out a second camera.

HTC mixed some misconception for the M8's release, pushing to be able to get to market in advance of Samsung's expected Universe S5. The big secret, which usually was eventually outed by simply UK retailer Carphone Storage place, was that the M8 was to go upon sale immediately on typically the day of launch in a few countries. But the accreditation and carrier collaboration necessary to get this work come in leaks. A lot of leakages.

HTC got its day-one retail launch, but misplaced control of the information through inevitable leaks.

Several fans' first proper consider the M8 came not from a press conference, but from your kid on YouTube blasting out Soulja Boy by means of the phone's BoomSound audio speakers. HTC got its day-one launch, but paid with regard to it by lOSing control over the pre-launch message.

A single the whole, the 2rd-gen HTC One was since popular as the 1st, and HTC was the beneficiary of the unspectacular Samsung phone of that year, the plasticity Universe S5. But while the particular company was as solid as ever in style, it hadn't made upwards much ground in their main area of weakness: the image. And it still had to compete with the particular big marketing bucks of Samsung, Apple and LG.

And last but not least, the M8 had another honour to its name: the very last Yahoo Play edition handset in order to be sold before typically the series was mothballed. For connoisseurs of the share Android experience who had been unconvinced by the plasticky Nexus 5, the GPe M8 became a enthusiast favourite.

# Samsung slumps

There are quarrels about when Samsung genuinely peaked, but it's obvious that 2014 was a new humbling year for typically the world's greatest Android phone producer. After seeing unbridled success in 2013 with the Galaxy S3 and parleying that brand recognition together with the Galaxy S4 a new year later, the relax of the smartphone industry was advancing while Samsung Korea was doing many similar.

The big boys got caught up and exceeded Samsung in many techniques. And a cavalry of smaller players was pressing everyone to do far better.

When the Galaxy S5 found its way to early 2015, additional manufacturers had caught up to and overtaken Samsung in a variety of ways. Create quality? Others were experimenting with metal and cup as Samsung stuck to be able to plastic. Software? Samsung phones ran the same Snapdragon 801 chips as rivals, however the software was lagging and ugly. As buyers were ready to improve from their Galaxy S3s, the mobile landscape got drastically changed THE NEW HTC was building beautiful mobile phones completely out of metallic with scaled-back software, LG ELECTRONICS had its revitalized H series, Motorola was back with a fresh get on smartphone design in addition to software, along with a cavalry of small manufacturers was pushing everyone to accomplish better.

But the Galaxy S5 has been basically the same since the past two iterations. It had a rather larger display screen, but was still manufactured out of incredibly low-cost feeling and looking plastic. The software program still had dozens associated with useless features and had been looking a little dated. Camera quality was improved together with a new ISOCELL messfuller, unfortunately he horrid in reduced light and couldn't be competitive with the optically-stabilized cameras from rivals. The addition of waterproofing was made welcome, but was hardly adequate to make up for the missteps elsewhere.

Past due 2014 created a tiny design revolution for Samsung, along with the Galaxy Alpha and Note 4.

With an increase of opposition and a lack regarding big features to get men and women enthusiastic about the Galaxy S5 itself, Samsung did not have a runaway hit on its hands in the way it did with previous Galaxy H phones. When someone was walking into a service provider store looking for a phone they no longer had typically the default thought of "iPhone or Galaxy" presently there were all compelling options that were worth their own attention.

The realization had been a cold one the Galaxy S5 just wasn't selling in typically the way that previous Universe S devices had, in addition to that wasn't something Samsung had dealt with this years. Realizing that alter and improvement were necessary to maintain the rapid pace of innovation within the Android space, Samsung Korea went with a full re-tooling of its technique with the releases regarding the Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy Note 4.

Samsung swapped out nearly all of typically the plastic in these phones together with finely-machined metal and restricted tolerances, improved the digicam experience substantially, and also started to realize that its software was overbearing and needed pruning back. It was a fast response for the criticisms regarding the Galaxy S5, in addition to folks noticed.

While we all wouldn't see a full revitalization of Samsung's cell phone strategy until the subsequent year using the launch regarding the Galaxy S6, the Galaxy Alpha and Universe Note 4 were fantastic steps in the proper direction to keep ahead of the competition.

# LG ELECTRONICS G3 and the Quad HD era

"Steve Work was wrong, " LG's Doctor Ramchan Woo advised Android Central at the G3's London launch occasion in May 2014, "We love Steve Jobs, yet he was wrong. "

"Steve Jobs was wrong" on smartphone pixel thickness, LG said.

Woo had been talking about Jobs' oft-quoted remarks at the apple iPhone 4 press conference, wherever he spoke of "a magic number right close to 300 pixels per ", " where the human retina is unable to differentiate in between pixels on the screen placed 10 to 12 inch away.

LG, which got itself manufactured the very first "Retina" displays for The apple company, had just blown right past this magic amount with the G3's astronomically high 538-pixels-per-inch Quad HIGH-DEFINITION (2560x1440) panel. This had been an increased resolution display than in basically the highest-end TVs, in the hands of your hand. In addition to there was scepticism whether or not we really needed these kinds of a stupendously dense screen, and what other scientific trade-off there might be.

Like Samsung, LG today had a compelling, vertically incorporated smartphone.

It turns out there were a few. The G3's battery existence was decent, although not fantastic. And that "2K" display produced more muted colours than rival 1080p LCDs. But it was a unique selling point for LG ELECTRONICS, at a time when it was hard to identify against local rival Samsung Korea. The LG G3 had been also certainly one of only a new few phones at the particular time with optical image stabilization (OIS), which assisted it outperform Samsung inside night photography. And their laser-assisted autofocus, adapted coming from LG's vacuum cleaner automatic robot technology, gave it one more technological first to brag about.

Just as Samsung Korea was building vertically built-in Galaxy smartphones, LG had been finally starting to power its strengths in organic displays, camera modules (though Sony still provided typically the sensors), batteries and, well, lasers. So that as Samsung slumped in 2014, the G3 helped LG to a new bumper year.

However, many disadvantages remained. Software design plus performance were pain details for LG. And whilst the newest, geometric, pared again "LG UI 3. 0" was an improvement about the technicolor mess regarding the G2, it had been susceptible to intermittent lag, and often overbearing in the plastering of squares plus circles over Android's customer interface.

LG's still not necessarily top of the stack when it comes in order to software design. And additional QHD phones would adhere to later in 2014, since display and chipset manufacturers got the handle about things. Nevertheless, the G3 was an important high normal water mark for LG in conditions of technological differentiation.

# Lollipop, plus a new method of Nexus

Autumn means it's time for a new variation of Android and fresh Nexus things for that to run on. In October of 2014, of which meant Lollipop and 3 new pieces of nexus Hardware — the Nexus 6, the Nexus 9 and the Nexus Player.

The largest change to Google android in 36 months brought the new design language in addition to a multitude of under-the-hood changes.

After several years of Holo design, Matias Duarte and his guys of merry men unleashed Material Design and style on us with Google android 5. 0 Lollipop. The particular changes were visually diverse brighter colours, leaner fonts and a careful design that was constructed within the idea of levels of paper met with mixed reply through the Android OS faithful, but most of typically the industry praised the logical and beautiful design.

Substance Design, and many of the 1000s of new APIs were opened up to Android OS developers early, through the particular "Android L" (as it was then called) creator preview. For the 1st time in years, devs could get the upcoming release of Android upwards and running on Nexus 5 and Nexus seven devices months prior to the final code drop.

There is the lot to like with Lollipop outside of the design since well. The new Faucet and Go setup method made it simpler to be able to move from one Android to be able to another, Guest Mode in addition to pinned applications for all those times you need to permit someone borrow your telephone and Overview, the fresh multitasking view made regarding the way to swap between applications and keep program what could be running. Naturally , a little Motorola DNA was there, particularly the ability to state "OK Google" while your phone was in life, as well as the new Ambient Show dropped a little bit of information on your own screen while the show was "off" and non-productive. Good things all-around, whether or not you weren't keen on Substance Design.

In the beginning of Lollipop, there had been bugs. Lots of insects.

Of course, plenty of bugs came along with Lollipop, too. ThOSe were categorized reasonably quickly with up-dates, which of course have been slower to make that out to other gadgets that didn't say Nexus on the back. Early on versions of Lollipop upon some models, for instance the Moto X or perhaps the Galaxy Note some, were not something any person ought to be proud of. Android OS 5. 1 ) 1 fixed almost all of the difficulties, and Lollipop turned out to be a worthy update with regard to productivity, stability and protection.

Within the hardware side, Google furthermore released three distinctive devices to showcase what has been new, and show just what could be done.

The Motorola-built Nexus 6 was a new 6-inch beast that polarized almost everyone. Beyond the type — the Nexus six was undoubtedly huge the price of Google's 2014 handset took several by surprise. As oppOSed to maintaining the trend of making well-built budget handsets, the Nexus 6 was costed just like any other high-end model from every other manufacturer. Motorola's exceptional construction and Google's fresh OS wasn't enough to be able to get many people to spend $500 (or more) regarding an unlocked phone, and also this certainly drew some colourful comments across the World wide web. Using said and completed (and now that you can get a Nexus 6 for a great deal less of the cash) typically the Nexus 6 was a single of 2014's best mobile phones if you might get your hands around typically the big heavy frame.

64-bit Android was in for a rocky start on the particular temperamental Nexus 9 capsule.

Since it was furthermore time for a brand new pill, Google, HTC and -NVIDIA got together and delivered us the Nexus nine. The Nexus 9 introduced two big changes in order to the field of Android tablets — 64-bit hardware and a new 4: 3 aspect proportion display. Within the software part the Nexus 9 fought with the same Lollipop issues the Nexus 6 did, and early models had some production top quality issues to go alongside with them. It as well had very the pricey price tag, and wedding party was tepid initially. At some point, issues like "bouncy" backs, memory leaks and higher prices were sorted away and the Nexus 9 makes for a good tablet for almost any Android fanatic. Your videos will nevertheless be letterboxed due to the aspect ratio, but typically the 64-bit NVIDIA TK1 in addition to Kepler GPU certainly tends to make up for it.

Lollipop also spawned a little bit regarding an offshoot for typically the family room with Android TV. Android Lollipop at typically the core, views and characteristics were specialized for any "10-foot interface" that supplanted the now-dead Google TV. For developers to test out there applications suitable for this 10-foot interface, reference hardware had been required hello Nexus Player. A small, flat black puck that got simple connection options HDMI, power and USB and underpowered equipment, the Nexus Player remaining many disappointed. The idea was to plug the Player into your TV, sign in along with your Google account, and enjoy lots of video games and entertainment.

Unfortunately, typically the Intel Atom processor inside Player didn't have the energy to make any of this enjoyable, and the particular 8GB of storage intended you couldn't install extremely much of it to begin with. The Nexus Player — especially with Intel equipment inside — makes best sense for any developer research device. But consumers were not happy, and still cannot recommend the Nexus Participant as anything except a new fancy (and more expensive) Chromecast replacement.

## Material Design and style

Fun fact: A computer doesn't have to have a graphical user interface. This really is something the Linux faithful the open-source OPERATING-SYSTEM on which Android will be built know full well, having run "headless" distrOS right from the start of period. That doesn't really work to get a smartphone OS, regarding course. Therefore , Android offers a GUI.

But Android OS hasn't always had just what we'd consider as a very good user interface. Oh, it absolutely was plenty functional and started to be more refined over the particular years. But it was not until 2014 and the "Lollipop" release that typically the Android user experience actually had a firm base — and a foundation where developers could build.

"We wanted to take a radical new approach to be able to design, " Sundar Pichai who in 2014 was head of Google android, Chrome and Apps regarding Google said within opening that year's Yahoo I/O developer conference. "User experience are evolving swiftly, and we wanted to be able to rethink the user design and style experience in Android to be able to have a fresh, bold and new look. "

And also this being Google we are going to talking about, the new way wasn't restricted to just smartphones and tablets and typically the like.

"User activities usually are evolving rapidly, and we all wished to rethink the user design experience in Android OS to have a fresh, bold and new appear. "

Enter Material Design and style, and Matias Duarte.

Duarte once was VP of Human being Interface and User Knowledge at the now-defunct Palm, in charge of they that made typically the beloved UI in webOS. He left for Google in mid-2010. A pair years into his fresh gig having been quoted since saying having been "a 3rd of the method to exactly where I want to be" with Android. We may pOSsibly not have really understood it at the moment, but big things had been inside the works. And in the I/O conference within 2014, Duarte plus Company. unleashed Material Design when us all.

Duarte took to the stage. As well as in simply a handful of content he explained Material Design and style in a way that was as simple as the design vocabulary itself is to individuals who live and breath colours and textures.

"Design is important in today's world. That defines your experiences, and your emotions. So we challenged ourselves to create a new design that was not simply for Android phones plus tablets. We worked with each other Android, Chrome in addition to across most of Google to craft one regular vision for mobile, desktop and beyond.

"We needed a design that had been clear and simple which men and women would intuitively understand. So we imagined exactly what if pixels didn't just have colour, but in addition detail. What if there has been an intelligent material that was as simple as document but could transform plus change condition and react to touch?

"And this directed us to a approach of thinking that we contact Material Design Inc."

Truly, it's that simple. Photo, if you will, structure paper employed by school-age youngsters. (Only in more sophisticated, flat colours. ) Experience. Buttons. Lists. Actions. Almost all interacting alongside and about top of one another, with smooth, elegant transitions.

Of which, in a nutshell, is usually Material Design. And is actually not simply for operating-system user interfaces and application style. You see it in Google's web properties. In addition to Google's made it effortless for just about anyone to use it, with colour palettes and design libraries in addition to guidelines everything that is needed to grow beyond the formless generations many of us had in the past and into the future of user experience.

# ARC Welder: Quick Android software upon Chrome

Android isn't the only platform in Google's arsenal growing at the breakneck pace during the last couple of years, and along with that there's always several talk of crOSsover among Android and Chrome. Because Chrome becomes more in addition to more such as a standalone working system no matter where it truly is installed, access to be able to the Google Play Store's enormous library of content material sounds like the construction for a perfect tablet experience.

ARC welder is actually a first step, but Google's made no promises about a 'hybrid' Chrome & Android experience just yet.

While Google hasn't manufactured any promises towards of which hybrid experience just yet, the particular ARC Welder program tends to make it possible for Android OS developers to optimize in addition to test their programs regarding use in desktop Chrome. To help users know what this experience is usually going to look such as eventually, a handful associated with software are now offered to use on Chrome OPERATING SYSTEM as standalone software operating in their own house windows and behave close enough to native programs that will the imagination fills inside the gaps and enables everyone prepare for the future.

The big question right here is what happens subsequent? Will the Google Play Store become folded to the Chrome Web Store from some point? Perhaps even more important, will we notice Google work with their hardware partners to produce a Microsoft Surface-like encounter for Chrome and Android OS together on a single device? ARC Welder is usually plainly one of how Yahoo thinks this would work, in addition to folding both of these experience collectively will undoubtedly produce responses to these questions.

# Meats and Greet: The Big Android BBQ

It's no secret that there are a pretty big community of Android OS developers and enthusiasts available. And there's no shortage of long-time Android consumers who have learned they will are physically near the other and plan some form of get together to reveal some knowledge and possess a good time. But the folks at IDEAA are now accountable for activities all around the globe to make this a lot easier.

It started with all the Big Android BARBECUE, a huge three-day event inside Texas that combines a new social event with a developer conference. This celebration has spawned several individual day "Meat and Greet" events that start as developer sessions and wind down to evening interpersonal events. This team provides even started European events, and continues to end up being the greatest number of sociable events with a target bringing developers and non-developers together to share understanding and also have a good time.
