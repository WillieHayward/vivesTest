<h1 id="Google-Android-Pre-History"><a href="#Google-Android-Pre-History" class="headerlink" title="Google Android Pre-History"></a>Google Android Pre-History</h1><p>Android didn’t just happen. The origins of the world’s dominant mobile operating system can be traced right back to the beginning of the prior decade, through the work of founder Andy Rubin, and Google, which was eager to establish itself as a major player in the mobile future.</p>
<p>In the first part of our Android History series, functioning back on the earliest origins of the OS, the road to starting the original Android phone, the T-Mobile G1, and several of the influences that designed Android’s early days. Plus we’ll take a unusual take a look at one of the early Android prototypes that never saw the light of day.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="The-mobile-world-circa-2006"><a href="#The-mobile-world-circa-2006" class="headerlink" title="The mobile world, circa 2006"></a>The mobile world, circa 2006</h1><p>Inside the world of technology in general, and mobile technology in particular, the mid-2000s now seems like ancient history.</p>
<p>The rumoured iPhone was actively refused by Apple. Netbooks were the hot new category of ultra-portable computing device. Typically the tablets through the day looked like your clunky work laptop with the keyboard sliced off. There was no Twitter. YouTube was a scrappy startup. Windows Landscape was a thing.</p>
<p>The particular smartphones of the time were, by modern specifications, slow, clunky and unattractive landscape completely outclassed by Symbian, Windows Cell phone and BlackBerry where efficiency was king. Though the idea of a telephone being more than only a phone was steadily attaining traction, the concept of a mainstream smartphone remained something of an Zusammenstellung Einander Widersprechender Begriffe.</p>
<p>The smartphones of the mid-2000s weren’t just basic from a technological standpoint, they were a minefield for developers, and in many markets mired in carrier restrictions much more than we withstand today. User experience and ease of development came second to competing corporate interests contrary to the relatively open associated with PERSONAL COMPUTER and web development.</p>
<p>Which is background against which Android OS now the world’s most popular mobile operating-system was conceived. And as we’ll discover through this course, Android’s openness though not without its mistakes allowed it to gain traction against the shut competition.</p>
<h1 id="Andy-Rubin-and-Threat"><a href="#Andy-Rubin-and-Threat" class="headerlink" title="Andy Rubin and Threat"></a>Andy Rubin and Threat</h1><p>Several years before Android existed, there was a little mobile software company called Danger, founded by veteran Apple engineer Andy Rubin.</p>
<p>The one huge claim to fame Danger got was your Hiptop, a mobile phone with a landscape computer keyboard and software that made instantaneous messaging, web browsing, and email equally important in the interface.</p>
<p>Through a partnership with T-Mobile, Danger re-branded the Hiptop to Sidekick, and the cult following that brand gained was unique for its time.</p>
<p>Danger’s services, rather than the hardware itself, was the product for sale</p>
<p>What made Danger’s Sidekick so successful was a revenue-sharing business structure that, at the time, was wildly different from the standard mobile business design.</p>
<p>Danger’s services, rather than the hardware itself, was the product for sale. By selling the hardware dangerously in close proximity to cost and sharing service profits with T-Mobile, Sidekicks were able to create a niche that competed immediately with Blackberry and Microsoft in the smartphone room.</p>
<p>Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin soon were spotted rocking Sidekicks just about everywhere they went ‘after all, might be better than being able to use Google Search no matter where you were’ Then Danger’s board of directors voted to replace Andy Rubin. Using a domain name he’d owned or operated for a while already, Rubin formed a new company focused on making a platform that was available to all software developers.</p>
<h1 id="Android-Inc"><a href="#Android-Inc" class="headerlink" title="Android, Inc."></a>Android, Inc.</h1><p>Android, Incorporation. was a standalone software company with no product to sell for two years. During almost all of this time, Rubin basically financed the company himself. Together with a smaller team of software engineers and a plan to make the latest of smartphone software, the company focused on an open-source evolution of many of the ideas that began at Danger.</p>
<p>By concentrating on the best web-connected experience they could, and creating an environment any developer could build on, Android had a solid plan that investors quickly hopped on in order to was finally pitched with them in June 2006. While plenty of buyers were looking to get in on this next-gen mobile experience, Google found itself in need of a mobile phone company to compete with Microsoft and Blackberry. Web page and Brin wanted more phones with Google as the default search engine, and an open platform like Android offered a great way to accomplish exactly that.</p>
<p>Page and Bout wanted more phones with Google as the default search engine.</p>
<p>By the ending of 2005, Rubin and his team were set up in offices in Mountain View, Calif., hidden away from the world, while they individuals this new company to finish this combined vision.</p>
<h1 id="Prototypes-The-road-from-Quicker-to-the-G1"><a href="#Prototypes-The-road-from-Quicker-to-the-G1" class="headerlink" title="Prototypes: The road from Quicker to the G1"></a>Prototypes: The road from Quicker to the G1</h1><p>Yet applications are nothing without hardware. Although many will bear in mind the T-Mobile G1 as the first Android cell phone, sporting a QWERTY slider design and a large (for the time) touchscreen, this was just one of many designs under concern by Google and manufacturer partner HTC, which for many years lived as a nameless ODM.</p>
<p>The particular HTC-built ‘Sooner’ looked more like the BlackBerry devices of the time.</p>
<p>The particular best-known prototype handset was known by the codename “Sooner. “ The HTC-built slab looked more like the BlackBerry devices of the time than the touch-focused designs in the future, with a full QWERTY computer keyboard below a 320x240 display.</p>
<p>HTC Europe’s Product and Services Director, Graham Wheeler, told Android Central that the partnership with Google consisted of those two main designs, and that for HTC and its device testers Android represented a drastic vary from the Home windows Mobile-based smartphones of the time. “There were two different IDs” a QWERTY keyboard design, and then the G1 as well. So we were looking at them both, inch Wheeler says. “It was a different OS and had a very different paradigm to Windows Mobile at the time, that has been much more tech-savvy. “</p>
<p>Showing on HTC’s history with Windows Mobile in the mid-2000s, HTC America Leader Jason Mackenzie told AIR CONDITIONING UNIT, “If you go back again to that point it was actually a huge risk that HTC took. With that time Microsoft and Yahoo weren’t exactly the best of friends. “</p>
<p>“At that time, even with the momentum that Apple was making with iPhone, there were people who said ‘I have to have a keyboard. ‘“</p>
<p>The company’s CEO also played a key role in getting HTC in on the ground floor with Android, Mackenzie explains. “Peter Chou had a good relationship with Andy Rubin returning to when he was at Threat. So they talked, and what we were really thrilled about was a system that was Internet-based and giving consumers an chance to position the Internet in their pockets. “</p>
<p>“It was a time when [consumers] weren’t all comfortable with an all-touch screen. Even with the momentum that Apple was creating with iPhone, there was people who said ‘I have to have a keyboard. ‘ CASING was still a successful company at that time. So We think both parties noticed the opportunity “let’s enable a strong touch interface that offers the Internet, puts that in people’s pants pocket” but that’s kind of a gateway to this new touch thing. “</p>
<p>It would’ve recently been difficult for anyone to predict the meteoric rise that Android would eventually enjoy, but Mackenzie recalls plenty of buzz around the G1 from within HTC prior to release.</p>
<p>“We were excited to really, really break the restaurants from our engineers. inch</p>
<p>“I can remember being super-excited about it. We all knew it was going to be big. [Google] were all-in behind it. I think we knew it got the potential given their experience with the World wide web, given the platform and the roots than it and the freedom that we got as a manufacturer to push innovation in the program. Because as good a partner as Microsoft was and is, Google’s strategy was much different in the sense that ‘OK, we’re giving you a platform and you could go innovate. We want you ‘HTC’ to innovate.’”</p>
<p>“We were excited to really, really split the chains from our engineers. “</p>
<h2 id="The-Apple-Iphone-Influence"><a href="#The-Apple-Iphone-Influence" class="headerlink" title="The Apple Iphone Influence"></a>The Apple Iphone Influence</h2><p>There’s no denying the historical impact of the apple Iphone on the mobile landscape. Though it wasn’t the first full touchscreen phone, the iPhone re-thought the way a smartphone user experience should work, paving the way for the responsive, touch-based smartphones all of us use today. When it was first introduced in January 2007, however, many rivals were keen to dismiss it.</p>
<p>Dorrie Ballmer, then-CEO of Microsoft, famously laughed off of the original iPhone’s high price, carrier limitations and data rate restrictions. BlackBerry-maker RIM was equally dismissive at least publicly.</p>
<p>But it seems Google, with the own mobile OS already in the oven, could have been a far more agile competition. In 2013 The Ocean reported on the effect to the iPhone event from higher-ups on the Android team.</p>
<p>“As someone I was blown away. I wanted one immediately. But as a Google engineer, I thought ‘We’re going to have to get started on over, ‘“ Googler Philip DeSalvo is quoted as saying. “What we experienced suddenly looked just so… ‘90s [… ] It’s one among those things that are clear when you see it. “</p>
<p>“What we experienced suddenly looked just so… ‘90s. “</p>
<p>Andy Rubin’s reaction was equally passion, according to The Ocean “Holy crap. I guess we’re not proceeding to ship that telephone. “</p>
<p>“That phone” was “Sooner, “ the HTC-built device with a physical keyboard. The prevailing debate has been that the decision to ship a different phone ‘the touchscreen-centric “Dream, “ which became the T-Mobile G1’ was directly due to the arrival of the apple iPhone. Google could’ve launched Android on Sooner, well, sooner, but held off until it finally had something better capable of competing with Apple’s offering.</p>
<p>Others within the Android team have refuted that is the way things played out inside. Nevertheless, body fat denying that the iPhone kicked off the trend towards touchscreen-centric handsets that has continued to this day. Almost all opponents would be forced to react to this eventually, and it turns out Android was among the first to do so.</p>
<h2 id="The-Dream-comes-alive"><a href="#The-Dream-comes-alive" class="headerlink" title="The Dream comes alive"></a>The Dream comes alive</h2><p>Several prototypes were designed and rejected before the G1 was finalized and released in 2008. Companies like LG and Apple were pioneering an all-touch functioning system, but designers still felt the need for an actual keyboard and course-plotting buttons, which gave the G1 its lovable (but chunky) design. We expect there was also a little bit of Sidekick DNA built in as well, as there is a common feel when you slide the LCD up and out.</p>
<p>The design and form factor weren’t the only real things under development. The G1’s software brought what you should mobile that just hadn’t already been done before, at least not done particularly well. True multitasking, copy and paste and a pull-down warning announcement system were things mobile users got pumped up about. Although somewhat clunky and terribly slow by today’s specifications, the first version of Android was unique and a foretelling of things to come, regardless of who built your phone.</p>
<p>When the dust settled, and everyone involved signed off all the papers, we conclusion up with one of the most revolutionary phones ever. The features won’t impress anyone buying a smartphone today “a 528MHz single key CPU with 192MB of RAM and a 3. 2-inch 320 x 480 display” nonetheless they were enough to push the software and show everyone how much better a smart phone could be compared to what they were using back in 2008.</p>
<p>The G1 was a perfect base to build Android into what it’s become, simply because Google was willing to risk being different.</p>
<p>We take nearly all of this for granted today. Within a smartphone world that during the time was dominated by BlackBerry’s Curve, companies like Google and Apple were doing things a different way. The G1 was a perfect base to develop Android into what it can become, simply because Google was willing to danger being different. From the beginning, Google was utilizing open-source software in a way that would entice hardware manufacturers and carriers alike, in a package that provided services and an ecosystem that consumers grew to love. HTC was “allowed” to market the G1 as the HTC Dream, under its own brand using its own slight modifications, worldwide. Google providing a free operating system, complete with an application platform and submission method, had companies like Samsung and Motorola quickly designing their own devices to take advantage.</p>
<p>Only a few die-hard Android fans it’s still employing a G1 (and even then you’d be right to question them), but there is no question that its development and release has had an immense impact on this mobile landscape, and Google’s rise to dominance.</p>
<h1 id="NEXT-Android-comes-into-the-world"><a href="#NEXT-Android-comes-into-the-world" class="headerlink" title="NEXT: Android comes into the world"></a>NEXT: Android comes into the world</h1><p>With the first Android hardware out there on the market, the stage was set for Google’s OS to propagate into the world. The partnership with HTC and T-Mobile was a start, but it would take greater than a single phone on a single carrier for Android to take on the established players, not to mention Apple, which was growing from durability to strength in mobile.</p>
<p>In this series’ next instalment, we’ll look at the impact of the G1 on the mobile landscape, the early visual styles of Android, and the nuts and mounting bolts of the Android Open-Source Project. And we’ll see how an huge partnership with Motorola and Verizon resulted in the beginning of an iconic brand in the U. H.</p>
